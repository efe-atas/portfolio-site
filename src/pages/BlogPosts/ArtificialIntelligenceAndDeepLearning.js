                    <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                    <p>
                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the most transformative technologies of our time. 
                        It encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically 
                        require human intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, 
                        decision-making, and language translation.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Deep Learning: A Subset of AI</h2>
                    <p>
                        Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning within AI, has revolutionized how we approach 
                        complex problems. It uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain to learn 
                        from large amounts of data. Through multiple layers of processing, these networks can 
                        identify patterns and features at increasing levels of abstraction.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Key Components of Deep Learning</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Neural Networks</li>
                        <li>Training Data</li>
                        <li>Optimization Algorithms</li>
                        <li>Model Architecture</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Applications in Modern Technology</h2>

                        autonomous vehicles to recommendation systems and natural language processing, these 
                        technologies are reshaping industries and creating new possibilities.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Impact on Various Industries</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery</li>
                        <li>Finance: Risk assessment and fraud detection</li>
                        <li>Transportation: Autonomous vehicles and traffic management</li>
                        <li>Entertainment: Content recommendations and gaming</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
                    <p>
                        As we continue to advance in AI and Deep Learning, we can expect even more breakthrough 
                        applications. The future holds promise for more sophisticated AI systems that can better 
                        understand and interact with humans, while also solving increasingly complex problems.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        The field of AI and Deep Learning continues to evolve rapidly, offering new opportunities 
                        and challenges. As we move forward, it's crucial to understand both the potential and 
                        limitations of these technologies, ensuring their responsible development and implementation.
